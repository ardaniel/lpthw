and, or, not: Python logic operators
import, from: import a module, or import a function from a module
if, elif, else: conditional logic
pass: do nothing
del: used to remove a variable, or an item from a list
while: open-ended loop (can be infinite)
global: defines a global variable
assert: asserts a condition that should be true; raises an error if the asserted condition isn't met
yield: produces a term from an iterable generator
break: breaks out of a loop or code block
try, except: attempt a function; if an exception arises, handle it
print: print something
class: No clue.  Please, OO coders, keep it simple for the rest of us!
exec: executes arbitrary Python code
for, in: for-next looping; iterating over a list
raise: raises an exception
continue: skips the rest of the loop and increments the loop
try, finally: attempt a function; if the exception is not handled in any else/ except, use the handler specified in finally
is: check if two objects share the same memory location (usually "if a is None")
return: return a value from a function
def: define a function
lambda: construct an anonymous function

True: boolean "true"
False: boolean "false"
None: null type
strings: "this is a string"
numbers: 1, 2, 3, 4, -23
floats: 4.56, 87.99, 1.0000
lists: ['this', 'is', 'a', 'list']
