Just working through Learn Python the Hard Way with the help
of the PyLadies (http://www.pyladies.com/).

You can get your own copy of LPTHW at:

I've added a PDF with Zed's function checklist (from Exercise 18)
and a quick truth-tables flashcard script for practicing your truth
tables in Exercise 27 (because I'm too lazy to get a Sharpie and
some index cards when I have Python to do that for me).  Enjoy!
